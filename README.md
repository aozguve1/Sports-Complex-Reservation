# ITU Sports Complex Reservation System

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a comprehensive mobile application for Istanbul Technical University (ITU) to streamline the reservation process of various sports facilities within the university. The app will replace the current manual reservation system, eliminating the need to call staff for availability, send payments to bank accounts, and print bills. Our solution will offer an efficient, user-friendly online platform for reserving sports facilities, including swimming, gym, basketball, court tennis, table tennis, and more.
